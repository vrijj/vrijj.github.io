<p>Card: An information friction and perhaps a lack of sophistication. One of the interesting things that I’ve witnessed in my 25 years as a professional economist is the changing character of the students that I see in graduate school. Every year I do a poll of students and ask how many of their parents have Ph.D.s. That ratio is now close to 60 percent, even at Berkeley. We are getting a very select group of people going into Ph.D. programs, who have very different backgrounds from the average person in the country. I think that is a little troubling. It means our students don’t really understand what a big leap it is for some families to send a child to college.</p>
<p>They don’t think about college as a difficult choice, because everybody in their family has high education, and all their friends went to college and will probably go further. We live in a stratified society. There are many families with very high levels of education who are doing extremely well, others with much lower levels of education who earn a modest living. I think it is important for labor economists to have some insights into the lower group as well as the higher group. In my experience, no one ever becomes a labor economist whose family was too well off. They go into other fields.</p>
